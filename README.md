---

To get started with the repository, clone it and then run `npm install` in the top-level directory to install the depedencies.

There are three folders in this repository:

## Client

You can run the client from the top-level directory with `node client/index`. This file is a script which will send an HTTP request to the server.

Think of the client as the _prover_ here. It needs to prove to the server that some `name` is in the `MERKLE_ROOT` on the server. 

## Server

You can run the server from the top-level directory with `node server/index`. This file is an express server which will be hosted on port 1225 and respond to the client's request.

Think of the server as the _verifier_ here. It needs to verify that the `name` passed by the client is in the `MERKLE_ROOT`. If it is, then we can send the gift!
